%   \item \textbf{{Price Area Congestion Management}}     \textbf \emph{(Restructured Power Systems)} \\
%  	Various methods for congestion  management in literature were reviewed. The method of price area congestion management in
% power markets of Nord Pool and India was studied in detail.The market splitting procedure used by Indian Energy Exchange
% is described in detail.
%
%   \item \textbf{{Dynamic studies on 2-generator system}}   \textbf \emph{(Power System Dynamics and Control)} \\
%        Time domain simulation of 2-generator system was done in matlab coding environment by
% numerically evaluating Dynamic and Algebraic equations (DAEs) of the model. Modelling of
% disturbances viz three-phase-fault, step change in generation of one of the generators and sudden load
% change was done. The dynamics observed in the measured states were in agreement
% with the eigenvalues of the system.
%
%   \item \textbf{{Simulation of STATCOM for mid-point voltage compensation}}  \textbf \emph{(Application of Power Electronics in Power Systems )} \\
%       This course project aimed at simulating indirect current control of STATCOM using Direct and indirect voltage control techniques.
