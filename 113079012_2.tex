 \begin{itemize}
 \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
 \item \textbf{Google Summer of Code, 2013:} \textbf{LDPC codes and more FEC in GNU Radio}  \textbf \emph{(June 2013-Present)}\\
        {\textbf{Mentor} - Dr.-Ing. Jens Elsner, CEL, KIT.   }          %\qquad \textbf{Software Used}: MATLAB}

        $\circ$ The project is to develop generic encoders and decoders for LDPC Codes in GNU Radio. \\
        $\circ$ As a part of this project we also improve encoders and decoders for BCH and RS codes. \\
        $\circ$ Algorithms for obtaining LDPC Codes are also implemented. \\
        $\circ$ Block for belief-propagation decoder is implemented. \\
        $\circ$ Block for back-substitution encoding is implemented. \\
        $\circ$ Project is open-source and is available at \url{https://github.com/manuts/ldpc}

        \item \textbf{M.Tech. Project:} \textbf{Application of LDPC codes to Multiuser Communications} \textbf \emph{(July 2013-Present)} \\
        {\textbf{Guide} - Prof. Sibiraj B Pillai, IIT Bombay.}            %\qquad \textbf{Software Used}: MATLAB}
        
$\circ$ LDPC codes are characterized by sparse parity check matrices \\ 
$\circ$ The project is to study LDPC encoding and decoding algorithms and extend them to multiuser scenario. \\
$\circ$ Belief-propagation decoder and back-substitution encoder blocks are developed.

        
\item \textbf{DARPA Spectrum Challenge:} \textbf \emph{(March. 2013-Present)}

$\circ$ During the hurdles and wild-card tournament we designed a transmitter-receiver pair, for two scenarios. \\
$\circ$ A pair of nodes competing against another to communicate a file in shortest time is designed. \\
$\circ$ A pair of nodes cooperating with two other pairs is designed. \\
$\circ$ All the pairs use same the same 5MHz frequency band. \\
$\circ$ Single-handedly pushed the team through wild-card tournament. \\
$\circ$ In the wild-card tournament our team surpassed teams from top universities and industries.

 \item \textbf{M.Tech. Seminar:} \textbf{Resource allocation in Wireless Networks}  \textbf \emph{(Nov. 2011)}\\
        {\textbf{Guide} - Prof. Sibiraj B Pillai, IIT Bombay.   }

      $\circ$ We studied optimal power allocation in flat-fading multiple access channels. \\
      $\circ$ Schemes achieving rate tuples under information theoretic setup were studied.
             
 \item \textbf{DSP Course Project:} \textbf{Design of Digital Filters} \textbf \emph{(Nov. 2011)}\\
	{\textbf{Instructor} - Prof. Vikram M Gadre, IIT Bombay. }
	
	$\circ$ Designed FIR and IIR filters. \\
	$\circ$ Designed filters under band-stop, band-pass and low-pass responses. \\
	$\circ$ Filters were designed under chebyschev and buttorworth approximations.
	
 \item \textbf{DSP Course Project:} \textbf{Localization of audio source} \textbf \emph{(Nov. 2011)}\\
	{\textbf{Instructor} - Prof. Vikram M Gadre, IIT Bombay. }
	
	$\circ$ In this project we designed a system to locate an audio source. \\
	$\circ$ The delay between audio signals captured from two mics is used to locate audio source.

  \item \textbf{{B. Tech. Main Project}: Study of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing}  \textbf \emph{(Jan. - June 2010)}\\
        {\textbf{Guide} - Prof. P Harikrishna Prasad, NIT, Warangal. }
        
$\circ$ The goal of the project was to study OFDM systems. \\
$\circ$ Matlab simulation of an OFDM system was done as part of this project.
