  \item \textbf{M.Tech. Project:} \textbf{Application of LDPC codes to Multiuser Communications} \textbf \emph{(July 2013-Present)} \\
        {\textbf{Guide} - Prof. Sibiraj B Pillai, IIT Bombay.}

LDPC codes are a class of linear error correcting codes characterized by a sparse parity check matrices. 
We study the current LDPC encoding and decoding algorithms and extend them to multiuser scenario.
GNU Radio blocks for encoder and decoder are developed.

 \item \textbf{Google Summer of Code, 2013:} \textbf{LDPC codes and more FEC in GNU Radio}  \textbf \emph{(June 2013-Present)}\\
        {\textbf{Mentor} - Dr.-Ing. Jens Elsner, CEL, KIT.}

        This project aims to develop generic encoders and decoders for LDPC Codes and other FEC schemes currently not avaialable in
        GNU Radio. GNU Radio is an open-source software defined radio platform. Various algorithms for obtaining LDPC Codes are 
        also implemented.
        
\item \textbf{DARPA Spectrum Challenge:} \textbf{Developing Communication system in competing and cooperating scenario}
\textbf \emph{(March. 2013)}

The challenge is to develop a pair of nodes consisting of a transmitter and receiver, in two scenarios, one competing with
another pair and the other cooperating with three other pairs.

 \item \textbf{M.Tech. Seminar:} \textbf{Resource allocation in Wireless Networks}  \textbf \emph{(Nov. 2011)}\\
        {\textbf{Guide} - Prof. Sibiraj B Pillai, IIT Bombay.}

       We studied various power allocation schemes in a wireless network in an Information Theoretic setup
       
 \item \textbf{DSP Course Project:} \textbf{Design of Digital Filters} \textbf \emph{Nov. 2011}\\
	{\textbf{Instructor} - Prof. Vikram M Gadre, IIT Bombay. }
	
	The project involved designing bandpass and bandstop digial filters in python.
	
 \item \textbf{DSP Course Project:} \textbf{Localization of audio source} \textbf \emph{Nov. 2011}\\
	{\textbf{Instructor} - Prof. Vikram M Gadre, IIT Bombay. }
	
	The project involved developing codes for locating an audio source from the delay between signal captured from 
	mics kept at a distance.

  \item \textbf{{B. Tech. Main Project}: Study of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing}  \textbf \emph{(Jan. - June 2010)}\\
        {\textbf{Guide} - Prof. P Harikrishna Prasad, NIT, Warangal. }

This goal of the project was to study OFDM systems and implement the same in matlab.

  \item \textbf{Industrial Training:} \textbf{BSNL Kerala Circle}  \textbf \emph{(May 2008 - June 2008)}
  
  Various aspects of GSM Architecture were studied. Specifically, training on OMC Radio, OMC Switch, Radio Planning and BSS were 
  obtained
